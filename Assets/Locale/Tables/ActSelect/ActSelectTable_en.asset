      The holy kingdom is already consumed by the desires of the people, who writhe
      between beast and human. One by one, you corrupt holiness into darkness. At
      last, even the king is plagued by anxiety and desire, heralding the onset of
      a war from which no god can save.

      to safeguard their deity, while the gods themselves suppress the shadows with

    m_Localized: The power of darkness, which even brought the Savior of Light to
      ruin, now engulfs the world. A world trapped in eternal slumber stirs by the
      birth of a faint light from the abyssal depths. In the heart of the deep, where
      light and darkness become one, a new chaos is born. The long dormant celestial
      guardians and the ancient beings that cradle the light of chaos rise to protect
      the newly born life. Will the light born amidst chaos ignite the flame to end
      the darkness?

    m_Localized: 'The Trial of Revelation is an unavoidable stage of fate where you
      confront your true self in the depths of darkness. Here, you will face two
      powerful elite foes, whose random appearances conceal hidden dangers that further
      test your resolve. At the end of this trial, a formidable boss awaits. In this
      world shrouded in darkness, enemies appear in a more powerful form, strengthened
      by the trials of destiny that you must overcome.


      However, this place
      is not just a battlefield. The Trial of Revelation is where you hone your inner
      self and awaken your true power within the darkness. As you surpass the limits
      of the enemies you encounter, you can refine your strength through endless
      challenges. With each trial you overcome, you sharpen your dark power and empower
      your followers. Finally, through the Trial of Revelation, you seize your world
      of darkness in your hands.



      This trial is not merely a stage to prove
      your strength; it is a grand finale where you discover your true essence and
      forge your destiny with your own hands.
